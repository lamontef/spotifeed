      <h1>Spotifeed has been discontinued.</h1>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, Spotify has made critical changes to their podcast
        download infrastructure that prevent Spotifeed from working. While
        Spotifeed can still access the show and episode data, the downloads
        themselves are no longer accessible.
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3at_Ev2kOoI"
          >He's dead, Jim.</a
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        The technical details: Spofiy's anon-podcast.scdn.co server has been
        discontinued. This served as an unauthenticated proxy server for podcast
        episode audio. They have switched to streaming directly from the
        podcast's source server. For non-exclusive podcasts, that is simply
        whatever is in the RSS feed (in which case, you can access those
        podcasts directly without Spotifeed's help). For exclusive podcasts,
        Spotify is using their audio4-fa.scdn.co server, which appears to be
        using an HLS stream that is not usable by general HTTP clients. That
        means Spotifeed would have to re-host the podcast audio files to make
        those downloadable, which is not feasible or legal.
